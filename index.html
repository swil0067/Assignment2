                        When the perecntage of people who had recieved the third dose vaccination really started to

                            href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/australia/">Worldometer</a>. Without
                        accounting for repeat cases, that is nearly 30% of the Australian population! <br><br>This
                        ubiquity, as
                        well as just getting out of the biggest peak of cases they would see throughout the pandemic
                        likely made the third dose of the vaccine seem much less necessary than it is.

                    <p>There are a many ways to increase vaccination rates, however one very important one that has
                        somewhat been implemented is donating vaccines. As the map above shows, the countries that have
                        bought many times more doses than their populations require are all in the High Income tier.
                        <br><br>
                        For lower income countries, that cannot necessarily afford to vaccinate, especially fully
                        vaccinate, their population and to therefore achieve herd immunity and protect everyone who has
                        not or cannot get the vaccine, higher income countries have donated vaccines to lower income
                        countries.
